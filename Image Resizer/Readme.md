## ðŸ“¸ Output

The resized image is saved with the name you provide in the `destination` variable (e.g., `NewImage.jpg`).

---

## ðŸ“š Concepts Used

- Reading and writing images using OpenCV
- Getting image dimensions using `image.shape`
- Resizing images using `cv2.resize()`

---

## ðŸ§  Learnings

This project helps you understand:
- Basics of OpenCV
- Image manipulation
- Working with image arrays and resizing techniques

---

## ðŸ“Œ Note

The script doesnâ€™t display the image using `cv2.imshow()` by default to keep it terminal-based. You can uncomment the line if you wish to preview the image.

```python
# cv2.imshow("title", image)
```
