# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains simple Python-based mini projects
Currently it features:
1. 🧠 Number Guessing Game
2. 🐍 Snake Water Gun Game

Both are interactive and help beginners understand Python basics like loops, conditionals, dictionaries, user input, and randomness.

## 1️⃣ Number Guessing Game

### 🎯 Objective
The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100. Your task is to guess the number. It will guide you with:
- "Higher number please" if your guess is too low
- "Lower number please" if your guess is too high

When guessed correctly, it displays the total number of attempts used.

### ✅ Features
- Random number generation
- Input-based guessing
- Feedback on guesses
- Tracks number of attempts

## 2️⃣ Snake Water Gun Game

### 🎮 Game Rules
This is a variation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game:

- Snake (`s`) drinks Water (`w`) → Snake wins 🐍 > 💧  
- Water (`w`) disables Gun (`g`) → Water wins 💧 > 🔫  
- Gun (`g`) kills Snake (`s`) → Gun wins 🔫 > 🐍  
- Same choices → Draw

### ✅ Features
- Player vs Computer
- Random choice for computer
- Dictionary-based mapping
- Outcome logic with clear rules

## ▶️ How to Run
