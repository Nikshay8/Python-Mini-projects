# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game

This is a terminal-based Python game where the computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and your goal is to guess it.

After each guess, the program gives you a hint:
- "Higher number please" if your guess is too low
- "Lower number please" if your guess is too high

The game continues until you guess the correct number. Once guessed, it tells you how many attempts you took.
