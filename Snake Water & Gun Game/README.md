# 🐍 Snake Water Gun Game (Python)

This is a terminal-based Python game inspired by the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors. In this version, you play against the computer using:
- 🐍 Snake (`s`)
- 💧 Water (`w`)
- 🔫 Gun (`g`)

Each round, the computer randomly selects one of the three, and your choice determines whether you win, lose, or draw.
